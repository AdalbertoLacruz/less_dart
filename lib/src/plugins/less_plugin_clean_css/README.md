-- Partially implemented --

## Usage

In the less command line: --clean-css="--options"

As directive inside the less code: @plugin "clean-css=options";

## Options
By now are usable:

	-b, --keep-line-breaks      Keep line breaks
	--s0						Remove all special comments, i.e. /*! comment */
	--s1						Remove all special comments but the first one
	--skip-advanced				Disable advanced optimization (more time demanding or less secure)
	--rounding-precision=[N]	Rounds to `N` decimal places. Defaults to 2. -1 disables rounding.
