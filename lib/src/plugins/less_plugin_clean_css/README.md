less-plugin-clean-css
=====================

Compresses the css output from less based on clean-css 3.2.0.

-- Partially implemented --

## Usage

In the less command line: --clean-css="--options"

As directive inside the less code: @plugin "clean-css=options";

## Options
By now are usable:

	--readable			keep line breaks for readability

	--skip-advanced     Disable advanced optimizations (more time demanding or less secure)


## Optimizations
See the working [optimizations](optimizations).
